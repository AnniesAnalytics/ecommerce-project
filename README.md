# ecommerce-project
Ecommerce is a huge space! Since I have a vested interest in getting into the ecommerce space, I wanted to test my SQL skills on a project utilizing a few different tables about sales data.

<br><br>I am not finished yet- this was a project I wanted to complete this weekend, but my 10 hour long detour to be allowed to upload files into my own server took priority. If you would like to read a blog post about how to dig into the program files of mySQL server and use the command line client in order to quickly upload large files, see [here](https://anniesanalytics.wixsite.com/annie-nelson/post/uploading-large-files-to-mysql-server-the-quest)
