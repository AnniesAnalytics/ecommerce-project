# ecommerce-project
Ecommerce is a huge space! Since I have a vested interest in getting into the ecommerce space, I wanted to test my SQL skills on a project utilizing a few different tables about sales data.

<br><br>I am not finished yet- this was a project I wanted to complete this weekend, but my 10 hour long detour to be allowed to upload files into my own server took priority. If you would like to read a blog post about how to dig into the program files of mySQL server and use the command line client in order to quickly upload large files, see [here](https://anniesanalytics.wixsite.com/annie-nelson/post/uploading-large-files-to-mysql-server-the-quest)

Query types used:
- count(distinct)
- Create table
- Load data
- min/max
- Sum
- Where between ‘’ ‘’
- Join
- With new as - stacked (cte’s)
- Avg
- Case when
- Group by
- Order by

In this project, I found the stores that sold the most, and the least. I looked into the performance of various departments within those stores. I also looked to see how different variables such as unemployment may be impacting sales. Generally, I did not find any big results that stood out in these categories- it might be worth pulling this data into R or Python to do some more in-depth analyses such as linear regression, but that is beyond the scope of this project.
