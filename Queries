I needed to clean the data in excel a little bit- changing the date format and adding a new column that could be used as the primary key to get the data into mySQL server. I also spent about 10 hours figuring out how to get into the inner files of MySQL and rewrite the settings so I could quickly upload data, because the way I have been using would have taken me about 3 days just to upload.

Initializing in the command Client: 

USE sales;

mysql> CREATE TABLE sales2(  Store int,  dept int,  Date datetime,  Weekly_Sales double,  IsHoliday varchar(45),  entry int NOT NULL,  PRIMARY KEY (entry) );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "C:/Users/kanel/Documents/salesdata/sales.csv"INTO TABLE `sales2`FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES;
Query OK, 421570 rows affected (5.20 sec)
Records: 421570  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0

Edit:
ALTER TABLE `sales`.`sales1` 
RENAME TO  `sales`.`sales` ;

What date range are we dealing with in these spreadsheets?

SELECT MIN(Date), MAX(Date)
FROM `sales`
2010-02-05- 2012-10-26

FROM `features`
2010-02-05-  2013-04-26 

So, they are not the same date range. 

A question that I have about the data is what do the A, B, and C store types mean? This is a potential answer, but it is not straightforward: https://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/retailing/retailing-in-india/retail-store-classification-2-categories-retailing/87239 

There are indeed only the three types: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Type)
FROM `stores`

Let’s see if there is a difference in sales between these three store types.  
WITH new AS
(SELECT b.Store, a.Type, a.Size, b.Weekly_Sales
FROM `sales` as b
JOIN `stores` as a
ON a.Store = b.Store)
SELECT Type, AVG(size), AVG(Weekly_Sales)
FROM `new`
GROUP BY Type


Not a huge difference. 


Let’s look at how much each of these stores are selling in a year: 
SELECT Store, SUM(Weekly_Sales) as annual_sales
FROM `sales`
WHERE Date BETWEEN '2010-02-05' AND '2011-02-05'
GROUP BY Store




So we know our top performers and worst performers in this date range. 

Who is our best performing store (all time)?
SELECT Store, SUM(Weekly_Sales) as total_sales
FROM `sales`
GROUP BY Store
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1
# Store	total_sales
20	301397792.45999974

Who is the worst?
# Store	total_sales
33	37160221.96


How does each department do in the best performing store?
SELECT Store, dept, SUM(Weekly_Sales) as total_sales
FROM `sales`
WHERE Store = '20'
GROUP BY dept
ORDER BY total_sales ASC

# Store	dept	total_sales


It seems like there is a department that loses money- perhaps this is returns? This is pretty low for returns however. There is also some departments that are scoring pretty low. I would want to ask more questions about what might be going on with these departments. 

Let’s see how our most poorly performing store is doing:
# Store	dept	total_sales

Again, I have questions about some of these lowest selling departments. 


Let’s see how different variables impact sales in our stores:
Holidays:

SELECT Store, AVG(Weekly_Sales) as average_sales, IsHoliday
FROM `sales`
GROUP BY Store, IsHoliday
ORDER BY Store

# Store 	average_sales	 IsHoliday




Let’s look at temperature and sales for just store 33 (Top seller):

WITH temp_33 AS
(SELECT Store, Date, 
CASE WHEN Temperature <30 THEN 'cold'
	WHEN Temperature >=30 AND Temperature <80 THEN 'normal'
	ELSE 'hot'
    END AS temp_cat
FROM `features`
WHERE Store = '33' AND Date < '2012-10-26'
ORDER BY date asc),
store_33 AS
(SELECT Store, Date, SUM(Weekly_Sales) as sales
FROM `sales`
WHERE Store = '33'
GROUP BY Date)
SELECT a.store, a.Date, a.temp_cat, b.sales
FROM `temp_33` as a
JOIN store_33 as b
ON a.Date=b.Date
ORDER BY a.Date ASC, b.sales DESC
